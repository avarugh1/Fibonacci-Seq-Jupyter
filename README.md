# Fibonacci Sequence with Jupyter notebook
## Utilizing Markdown, Latex, and Python 3

By Anson Varughese

A simple demo to familiarize myself with Jupyter and brush up on basic Python.

View with Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/avarugh1/FibonacciSeqJupyter/blob/master/FibonacciSequence.ipynb

Or view with https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/avarugh1/FibonacciSeqJupyter/blob/master/FibonacciSequence.ipynb as static content

### Summary Section :

The summary section is a simple interactive input box with timing comparisons between the multiple Fibonacci implementations. It requires proper setup of ipywidgets and enabling it in the proper environment https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36351109/ipython-notebook-ipywidgets-does-not-show. 

Colab should be able to handle this after the first run
